# automaticsummarize
this project is my final task to get bachelor degree on computer science. The main topic for this project is NLP (Natural Language Processing). The app is ranking every sentence of an article news based on PageRank score. PageRank score will decide whether the sentence is important and whether the sentence can represent the whole article so other sentences can be reduced

the code can be access thru: peringkasan BM25/final/summarize text-Copy1.ipynb

and the docs thru: Yurdha Fadhila - 165150200111094 - Skripsi.pdf
